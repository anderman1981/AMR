## 🛠️ AI Working Standards (The 5 Cs)
1. **Consistency**: Same rules, same results.
2. **Completeness**: Nothing is done until tested and documented.
3. **Clarity**: Code must be readable and self-explanatory.
4. **Compliance**: Project standards are non-negotiable.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Every task must leave the codebase better.

### Git & Task Workflow ("No ticket, no code")
- **Issues**: Always exist before code.
- **Branches**: `feature/ID-desc`, `fix/ID-desc`, `docs/ID-desc`.
- **Commits**: Follow Conventional Commits.

## 📂 Archiving & Documentation (AI History)

All AI-generated artifacts should be archived in `logs/AI_HISTORY/` to maintain traceability:
- `logs/AI_HISTORY/TASK/`: Checklist history.
- `logs/AI_HISTORY/PLAN/`: Approved implementation plans.
- `logs/AI_HISTORY/DOCS/`: Versioned walkthroughs.
- `logs/AI_HISTORY/FEAT/`: Feature descriptions.
- `logs/AI_HISTORY/FIX/`: Bug fix logs.
- `logs/AI_HISTORY/GIT/`: Git operation logs.

**Naming Convention**: `[TYPE]-[VERSION]-[BRANCH].md`
